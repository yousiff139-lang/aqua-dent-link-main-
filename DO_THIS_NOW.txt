================================================================================
DO THIS NOW - DEBUG APPOINTMENTS
================================================================================

I've added detailed console logging to show EXACTLY what's happening.

STEP 1: RESTART EVERYTHING
---------------------------
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npm run dev

(NEW TERMINAL)
cd dentist-portal
npm run dev

STEP 2: OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE
-----------------------------
Press F12 to open Developer Tools
Go to "Console" tab
Keep it open!

STEP 3: TEST DENTIST PORTAL
----------------------------
1. Go to: http://localhost:5174
2. Login with: michael.chen@dentalcare.com (or your dentist email)
3. Click "Appointments"
4. LOOK AT CONSOLE - You'll see:
   👨‍⚕️ AppointmentsTab - Dentist: ...
   📧 AppointmentsTab - Dentist Email: ...
   🔍 Fetching appointments for dentist: ...
   ✅ Fetched appointments: X appointments

STEP 4: TEST ADMIN PAGE
------------------------
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Admin Dashboard
4. LOOK AT CONSOLE - You'll see:
   🔍 Admin: Loading appointments...
   ✅ Admin: Loaded X appointments

STEP 5: CHECK DATABASE
----------------------
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

SELECT 
  dentist_email,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.appointments
GROUP BY dentist_email;

STEP 6: TELL ME
---------------
1. What does the console say?
2. How many appointments in database?
3. What is the dentist_email value?
4. What email are you logging in with?

Then I can fix it!

================================================================================
THE CONSOLE LOGS WILL TELL US EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG
================================================================================

Look for:
- ❌ Red errors
- 🔍 What email it's searching for
- ✅ How many appointments it found
- 📋 The actual appointment data

================================================================================
