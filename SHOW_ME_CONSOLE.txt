I NEED TO SEE THE BROWSER CONSOLE
================================================================================

I can see the dentist portal shows "No appointments yet" but I need to see
what the console says to know WHY.

STEP 1: OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE
-----------------------------
1. In the dentist portal (http://localhost:5174)
2. Press F12 (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Click the "Console" tab
4. Take a screenshot or copy the text

STEP 2: LOOK FOR THESE MESSAGES
--------------------------------
👨‍⚕️ AppointmentsTab - Dentist: ...
📧 AppointmentsTab - Dentist Email: ...
🔍 Fetching appointments for dentist: ...
Fetching appointments for dentist email: ...
Found X appointments for ...
✅ Fetched appointments: X appointments

OR

❌ No dentist email provided
❌ Error fetching appointments

STEP 3: RUN THIS SQL IN SUPABASE
---------------------------------
Go to Supabase → SQL Editor → New Query

Paste this:

SELECT 
  dentist_email,
  dentist_name,
  COUNT(*) as appointment_count
FROM public.appointments
GROUP BY dentist_email, dentist_name;

STEP 4: TELL ME
---------------
1. What does the console say?
2. What does the SQL query return?
3. What email are you logging in with in the dentist portal?

MOST LIKELY ISSUE:
------------------
The email you're logging in with doesn't match the dentist_email
in the appointments table.

Example:
- Login email: michael.chen@example.com
- Appointment email: dr.chen@dentalcare.com
- Result: No match = No appointments shown

QUICK FIX:
----------
Once you tell me the emails, I can give you SQL to update them to match.
